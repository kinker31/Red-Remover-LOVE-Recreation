THE BASIC GUIDELINES OR WHATEVER

0. Most of us should have Discord, so if you have any questions I need to answer (or anything I want to ask you), you know who to message. I can also start up a basic group chat if need be.

1. Try to follow the development roadmap.

2. Make sure someone else isn't trying to implement the stuff you're trying to implement.

I can't imagine there'd be much else, given this is a rather simple LUA game, but I'll add stuff here if need be.
