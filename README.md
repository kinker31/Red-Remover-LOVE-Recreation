# Red Remover: A LOVE Recreation
An attempt in LUA to recreate the once-popular Flash Game, Red Remover, and potentially add new features, more built-in levels, and a simple way of sharing files.

Currently only an in-progress engine demo.

**Red Remover belongs to Gaz Thomas of the Game Homepage.**
